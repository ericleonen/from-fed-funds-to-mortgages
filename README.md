# From Fed Funds to Mortgages
### An Empirical OLS Study of the Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism

---

A paper and an accompanying web app that helps people understand how the Federal Funds Rate empirically affects the economy.

## Abstract
This paper empirically examines the transmission of monetary policy from the
Federal Funds Rate to long-term borrowing costs. We focus on links between the policy
rate, to short-term rates, to long-term rates, and to mortgage rates. Using historical
interest rate data from 1981 to 2025, we estimate three ordinary least squares (OLS)
regressions for each stage of the transmission chain. Our results show that changes in
the Federal Funds Rate are positively related with short-term rates, which in turn are
positively related to long-term rates, which in turn are positively related to mortgage
rates. The effect is strongest between the Federal Funds Rate and short-term rates and
between long-term rates and mortgage rates, but weaker between short-term rates and
long-term rates. Our findings support and quantifies links in the the standard story of
the monetary policy transmission mechanism.

## Features
- Empirical model with real-world data
- Visualizes how Fed Funds changes:
  1. Impact short-term interest rates
  2. Affect long-term interest rates
  3. Influence mortgage rates
